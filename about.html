    <h1>Who we are</h1>
    <br>
    <p>We're a group of passionate beach perservaionist. It has become clear that throught the years
        (especially in the past 2 years) that our worlds beaches have been cluttered with litter. Often
        with plastics that harm sealife as well as paper and trash that could have been better disposed of.
        We here at [ADD NAME HERE] have made it our goal to reduce trash and promote a greener lifestyle.
