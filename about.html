    <h1>Who we are</h1>
    
    <p>We're a group of passionate beach perservaionist. It has become clear that throught the years <br>
        (especially in the past 2 years) that our worlds beaches have been cluttered with litter. Often <br>
        with plastics that harm sealife as well as paper and trash that could have been better disposed of. <br>
        We here at [ADD NAME HERE] have made it our goal to reduce trash and promote a greener lifestyle. <br>

    <h2>Here just some of the places our members have cleaned up over the years</h2>

    <!--Note: We could add images of the places listed here-->
    <ul>
        <li>Maui Beach</li>
        <li>Kauai Beach</li>
        <li>Laguna Beach</li>
        <li>Clearwater Beach</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why is beach pollution even a problem?</h2>
    <p>Swimming or being in contact with polluted beaches poses serious health risks. <br>
        Remember that polluted beaches affect both the sand and water at the beach so practice <br>
        caution anytime you see a polluted beach. The EPA estimates that up to 3.5 million get <br>
        sick from being in contact with sewage while swimming. This often leads to an upset stomach <br>
        but can lead to neurologicall disorders, hepitatis, and meningitits. <br>

    <p>Not only that but polluted beaches also destroys the habitats of several aninals. <br>
        This causes them to move other enviroments they may not be adapted to live in and <br>
        leaves the place open to oppurtunistic animals who may find the new trash ridden place<br>
        home. In any case whether it be for personal reasons or enviromental ones. Its important <br>
        to preserve our beaches.
