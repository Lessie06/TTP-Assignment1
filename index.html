    Pollution on beaches have caused many environmental, economic, and recreation affects.
    It causes habitats and plants to be destroyed and it is a public health risk.
    Polluted beaches can prevent economic growth in surrounding communities and due to this waste many beaches are abandoned.
    According to Conservation, "There’s so much junk at sea, the debris has formed giant garbage patches. There are five of them around the world, and the largest — the Great Pacific Garbage Patch — includes an estimated 1.8 trillion pieces of trash and covers an area twice the size of Texas."
